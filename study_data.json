Simultaneously, a jogger, wearing a gray shirt and shorts, was running across the crosswalk. The traffic light for the cross street was yellow, indicating an upcoming change. The BMW driver failed to yield to the pedestrian, causing the jogger to jump away to avoid being hit. The incident highlights unsafe driving behavior, likely due to the driver's inattention or impatience, and a failure to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk, potentially also running a red light if the turn on red was not permitted. The jogger may have been unaware of the approaching vehicle or assumed they had the right of way. The near-miss could have been prevented by the driver being more attentive and yielding, and by the jogger making eye contact with the driver.",
